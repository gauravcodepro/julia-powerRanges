# julia-powerRanges

- julia implementation of the recursive hash split instead of the nested list as list takes and stores more memory
- original powerRanges from Geo Pertea are here https://github.com/gpertea/PowerRangesR
- i coded using the recursive split so that it becomes faster and a linked Dict{String, String}() type declaration
